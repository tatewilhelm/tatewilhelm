This may surprise you, _(with me being an 8th grader who can barely tie his shoes)_, but I use linux as my daily driver.

I love Linux, the openness, open source utillities, libraries taking 10 seconds to install instead of manually moving DLLs. God, it's
so nice to have _**literally everything**_ in my computer available with a couple key presses.

Wanna install an **entire new desktop environment**?
```
$ sudo dnf install @kde-desktop-environment
```

Wanna make a cow say the first lines of _The Bee Movie_ script?
```
$ cowsay "According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground."
```

Want to destroy _**THE ENTIRETY OF YOUR LINUX INSTALL?**_

Easy, just 14 presses of a  key.
```
$ sudo rm -rf /
```

The point I'm trying to make, is that Linux trusts you. Linux is the most powerful software most people use, without 
even knowing it. Android, is just Linux with a fancy-schmancy SDK and utilities. 

Here's the issue. Linux as a desktop operating system, sucks.

## The problem with Linux

If you don't know, Linux has multiple distros. A distro is a version of Linux with extra utilities, a desktop 
environment, and maybe more depending on the distro. 

Problem is half of them are funkier than the 80's.

Let's take... [Manjaro](https://www.manjaro.org/) for example.

[Manjaro](https://www.manjaro.org/)... look, no offense to the maintainers of [Manjaro](https://www.manjaro.org/). Making and maintaining a distro is hard. Especially one with 
its own software instead of copy-pasting GNOME utilities. Genuinely, I mean no offense to them personally. 

But that doesn't mean [Manjaro](https://www.manjaro.org/) still isn't bad.

[Manjaro](https://www.manjaro.org/), hands down, is the worst distro I've ever used. I installed it on my Ryzen machine and every hour or two, it 
unexplainably froze, then shut down 2 minutes later. It is so distant from Arch that it makes most advanced fixes on the
Arch User Forms unusable. [Manjaro](https://www.manjaro.org/) could just be, a set-up arch, with some great utilities or a good package manager. 

**But no!** Let's make an entire different, worse kernel, that ignores the main philosophies of _"Keep it simple"_, and 
_"Always bleeding edge"_. Also, after all of that, lets say that [Manjaro](https://www.manjaro.org/) is a beginner-friendly distro.

[Manjaro](https://www.manjaro.org/) may be worse than your thumb being cut off, but the last part is a big problem with most distros. Most distros 
like to say that they are beginner-friendly. When Linux at all is not beginner-friendly. The only distro I can think of 
that comes even remotely close to being beginner-friendly, is Ubuntu. Even that is an overstatement.

Oh boy, the fanboys. Look, I want linux to be successful in the mainstream. But, if you're forcing your grandma to use 
linux because _"It's the better operating system,"_ stop.

Most people, they use their computer for taxes, and social media. That's it. I recommend Linux for any programmer, or
techie. Not some guy who just wants to pay his taxes.

While I do sound like I want to kick Linux into the shadow realm. I actually really like it.

## The good with Linux

Let me get this out of the way. I am a programmer, and a computer nerd. So this doesn't apply to the average person. 
Also, it's my opinion, so gut me from intestine to throat if you want.

God, I love package managers. Installing libraries used to be terrible. Moving files to Mingw's weird folder system is 
no longer an issue ever since I moved to Linux. Also downloads for weird or obscure pieces of software aren't really an 
issue anymore.

Also, the stability is nice. While some distros are terribly unstable. _Cough Cough... **[Manjaro](https://www.manjaro.org/)**_.

Some are really nice 
and stable. For example: Fedora, It's been my daily driver for about 4 months. And it hasn't crashed once. The only 
major issue I've had is nvidia drivers, and those aren't Fedoras fault.

## Linux is... cool
Overall my experience with Linux is great. I started with Linux with my Raspberry Pi 3 with Kano OS and Noobs when I was 11.
I ran [Manjaro](https://www.manjaro.org/) for 3 months transitioning from Windows. Never running [Manjaro](https://www.manjaro.org/), _again_. After that I've been running 
Fedora ever since. 

So yeah Linux is... cool, I guess.
