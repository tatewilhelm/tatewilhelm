## Why Java, why?

Java, as a whole, is not the best. While it's certainly not a *bad* language, it doesnt have the best language design. 

Why Java, do you require OOP? There's no point. Now every kid in a High School CS Program have to memorize the following phrase: "public class Filename public static void main capital String args".

That's so much boiler plate! It's needed just for a single line to run. Sure, some of it makes sense in the context of a class, but ***why for the main function.***  C does main functions better than Java, and thats saying a lot. 

Java also isn't the easiest to grasp. It's not the hardest, but it's not the easiest. It's a bit of a middle ground.

It's pretty easy to write basic code. Variables, loops, if statements, etc. are all pretty easy to grasp. But when you get into more advanced topics, it gets a bit more complicated. For example, Java's OOP is confusing at best, and castrophic at worst. OOP is about turning structs and functions into a much more rounded experience, not making all Java devs seem like babies by making sure they don't ***gasp*** **CREATE A ABSTRACT OBJECT**.

What Java doesn't seem to understand is that the issues in programming isn't developers calling code they're not supposed to, its having A GOOD LANGUAGE OVERALL.

While it may sound like Java is a terrible language, (which it is) there is one saving grace which is one of the sole reasons Java is still used today.

# Java, I Still Love You.

I'm just going to straight to the point. Java's Standard Library is on point. It makes writing code so *easy*. For example, in C, you have to dig on old websites from ancient times to find a standard function, and generally its not all to useful. The entire point of the standard library is to prevent code being written over and over again, which you have to do alot in C. Parsing files, for example, is a nightmare in C. In Java, to parse files you call `scan.nextWhatever`. THATS IT!

The only reason I still use Java is the gracefullness of it's standard library. Sure it's mediocore compared to some of the new fancy languages, but I usually use C. So this is a whole new world for me.
