So this year was my last year for UIL.

If you don't know what UIL is, UIL is the regulator of academic contests, sports 
contests, and other school events in the state of Texas. Since 2nd grade, I have been doing UIL A+ Academics annually. I
would practice multiple events(5 - 7 usually), and at the end of the first semester, there would a district competition.

I was never a sports person, still not. So, I never really had done anything with after school activities from 
kindergarten - 2nd. But when I was the age to start UIL contests, that was my thing. I always tried to be in the most, do the 
most, and win the most. I didn't really have an option. Sports was not at all my thing, so what else was I going to do.

Fast-forward 6 years, and here I am.

Instead of a **stupid 2nd grader with no options**, I, now, am a **stupid 8th grader with more options**.

I haven't put as much effort into UIL this year because I have other things now. I taught that robotics class in my 
local 4h program, gotten a lot more invested in programming, preparing for my future, my schools electives, etc. I have 
a lot more that I'm invested in. 

I have matured, (academic wise, not mentally. LOL.) So some dinky competitions that distract me half of the school year, 
is honestly not what I'm looking for anymore. I did like UIL, but I think its good I broaden my horizons.  I think its more 
fun doing other stuff, like making robots, and I don't think many colleges will see number sense medals from 7th grade 
and then think that's wonderful and accept me.

I like UIL, but if all I did was some competitions half the year, I don't think I'd be having as much fun as I am right now with school.
