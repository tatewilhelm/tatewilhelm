If you haven't seen a video of Boston Dynamic's Spot, [watch one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlkCQXHEgjA&ab_channel=BostonDynamics). It's so cool! Usually robots in the real world are just in factories, and not really as the old fasioned robots that can walk around and speak with that weird monotone voice. We may not be at the monotone voice part,(Good. That would be creepy.) but they are still extremely intresting. 

I thought making a robot dog would be a great project for learning arduino, and electronics a lot better. I did learn alot, but the project as a whole was a failure.
