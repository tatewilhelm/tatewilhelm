I'm currently sitting in my room, listening to *This Year* by The Mountain Goats, and I'm thinking about the last year, and how it was the best year of my life. I've decided to write this post as a way for me to process and disect this year. Perhaps you, my dear reader, could learn something from this post. Or maybe you'll just be bored. Either way, I hope you enjoy.

I started out my freshman year nervously. And honestly, rightfully so. I didn't quite like some of my classes, I was in band (by the way, I hate band), and High School was just foreign.

The nervousness quickly faded as the great parts of High School began to shine through. I made some really good friends, I began to exude my actual personality instead of the fake one I had in middle school, and I began to enjoy my classes.

You see, middle schoolers are dicks. Middle schoolers have the mindset where they believe being a dick is cool. Highschool is when most people began to rid themselves of that belief, making most people compassionate, unlike middle school.

On top of the much nicer people, my teachers are really fucking cool. Like, they're awesome. I don't have a bad teacher this year.

I improved alot in the fields I love, and ended up going to state in computer science.
