subtitle: Why did I make this?
---

I made this website while I was in the 8th grade, as a semiformal resume, portfolio, _thing._

I want to have a stable job, and get into a good college. Since my history is in programming/engineering, I think a look
into my late middle school/high school days will help secure jobs and college applications, and it will show I am invested in programming/engineering.

What im trying to say is, this website is here to show that I actually am invested in this and have done this for years.
I'm not a guy who picked up programming junior year of high school. I've been doing this for quite a while.

So look around, I guess.
