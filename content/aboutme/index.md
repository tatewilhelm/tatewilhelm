My name is Tate Wilhelm. I program and do all sorts of tech related stuff.

I am currently a high schooler, who enjoys programming and robotics. I am the lead programmer in my school's robotic program, a officer in my counties 4-H club, and I also founded, own, and run Canadian Technology.

I am an active developer and tinkerer, who enjoys spending his time making sometime dumb stuff, sometime cool stuff.
