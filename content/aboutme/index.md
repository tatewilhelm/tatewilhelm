My name is Tate Wilhelm. I program and do robot stuff. I have 2 cats, and I like jazz.

I am currently a middle schooler, who enjoys programming and robotics. I am the programmer on my robotics team, a member of my communities 4H Shooting program, and 4H cooking.

I am an active developer and tinkerer, who enjoys spending his time making sometime dumb stuff, sometime cool stuff.

I am the active maintainer behind [FTC Layer](https://github.com/ftc17191/ftclayer),a library for First Tech Challenge programming.  I'm also a
contributor to [VBEmu](https://github.com/tatewilhelm/vbemu), a cross platform emulator written in C.
