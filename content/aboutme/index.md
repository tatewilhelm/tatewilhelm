My name is Tate Wilhelm. I program and do robot stuff. I have 2 cats, and I like jazz.

I am currently a high schooler, who enjoys programming and robotics. I am the lead programmer on my robotics team, a member of my communities 4H, and I also founded, own, and run Canadian Texas Phone Repair.

I am an active developer and tinkerer, who enjoys spending his time making sometime dumb stuff, sometime cool stuff.

I am the active maintainer behind [FTC Layer](https://github.com/ftc17191/ftclayer), a library for First Tech Challenge programming.
