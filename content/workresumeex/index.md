## About Me
Hey.

My names Tate. I do a lot of programming and engineering. I play drums in my school's band, and my favorite subject in
school is math. 

I come from a small town in North Texas and attend Canadian Middle School. I'm involved in my school's FTC team, my schools band, and my community's 4H activities.


I have 2 cats. They're cute.
