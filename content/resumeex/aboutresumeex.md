title: What's ResumeEx?
---

Short Answer: My resume but instead of a double-sided sheet of laminated paper, a 3-5 page resume.

Long Answer: In object-oriented programming language a class with an Ex at the end of it, is usually that class with 
some extras added. Hence, the Ex at the end of Resume means: Resume with some
extra bits. So ResumeEx is just a more extended resume, with much more detail. 

I recommend looking at it if you want to know more detail into what I do. But my normal resume is good if you just want 
to know a condensed version.
