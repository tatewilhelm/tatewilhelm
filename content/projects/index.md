## Projects I actively maintain / have contributed to.
**These projects are ones I consider good, and noteworthy.**

[FTC Layer is an android library I created for the explicit purpose of making FTC programming less cumbersome, and overall easier.](https://github.com/ftc17191/FTCLayer)

[The Documentation for FTC Layer was created as a collaboration between me and a fellow robotics nerd, Jack Crane.](https://ftclayer-docs.pages.dev)

[Another collaboration, was when me and another programmer from my school, Logan Gatlin, created a emulator collection, called VBEmu.](https://github.com/tatewilhelm/vbemu)

[BrainFrick was born out of the need for an actually good BrainF*ck interpreter, compared to ones that didnt work on my computer, (for some reason).](https://github.com/tatewilhelm/brainfrick)

## Failed Projects
**Failure is important. There is no better way to learn, than to fail.
These projects are ones that never really caught on, or did much.**

[Open YT Tool was a replacement for sketchy YouTube download websites, however soon after finishing, i found out what youtube-dl was.](https://github.com/tatewilhelm/open-yt-tool)

## Experimental Projects
**These projects aren't necessarily failures, but they aren't very good, either.**


[I made software, that monitors advanced information of Lego EV3s.](https://github.com/tatewilhelm/ev3-checker)

[Bash profiles, and installing plain old elfs, are annoying. So, I made a tool called pathtool to add paths to the $PATH variable.](https://github.com/tatewilhelm/pathtool)
