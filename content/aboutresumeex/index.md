title: What's ResumeEx?
---

## Short Answer
My resume but instead of a double-sided sheet of laminated paper, a 3-5 page resume.

## Long Answer
In object-oriented programming languages, a class with an Ex at the end of it, is usually that class with 
some extras added. Hence, the Ex at the end of Resume means: Resume with some
extra bits. So ResumeEx is just a more extended resume, with much more detail. 

I have two ResumeEx's. One contains most of my academic awards from 7th grade and up, and more so ment for school purposes. The other is for work. They both share inforation, but more detailed information may only be in one.
